/*
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    while (left < right) {
        // Find the middle index of the current range by averaging left and right and rounding down
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        // Compare the middle element with its right neighbor

            // So, we update left to mid + 1
            left = mid + 1;

    // When left and right converge to the same index, they will point to the peak element
