Difference between subarray and subsequences and subset 
https://www.scaler.com/topics/difference-between-subarray-subset-and-subsequence/


In mathematics, combination and permutation are two different ways of grouping elements of a set into subsets. 
In a combination, the elements of the subset can be listed in any order. 
In a permutation, the elements of the subset are listed in a specific order.


Subarray - is any contingous part of a given array;
Eg = [1,2,3]
all Subarray are
1. [1]
2. [2]
3. [3]
4. [1,2]
5. [2,3]
6. [1,2,3]
No. of subarray = n * (n+1)/2

Subet - > any possible combination of given original array or set. Its like powerset of a set.
no. of subset = 2^n

subsequence -> is a sequence of the elements of the array obtained by deleting some elements of the array.
no. of subsequence = 2^n

1. Generating subsequences and subset 

function()
{
    arr.push(nums[index])
    function(index+1,arr)
    arr.pop(nums[index])
    function(index+1,arr)
}
